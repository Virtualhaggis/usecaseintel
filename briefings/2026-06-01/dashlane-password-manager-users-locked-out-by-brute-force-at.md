Multiple Dashlane users have been locked out of their accounts following brute-force attacks that attempted logins from distant locations and unknown devices.
In a statement to BleepingComputer, the password management service confirmed that the suspensions were part of an automated security response designed to protect against account hijacking.
“We can confirm that certain Dashlane user …
