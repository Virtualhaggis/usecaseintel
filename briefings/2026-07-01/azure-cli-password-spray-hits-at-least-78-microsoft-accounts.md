Azure CLI Password Spray Hits at Least 78 Microsoft Accounts in 81M+ Attempts 
 Ravie Lakshmanan  Jul 01, 2026 Password Security / Cloud Security 
Cybersecurity researchers have warned of a "massive, ongoing, automated password spray attack" aimed at Microsoft's Azure command-line interface (CLI), compromising dozens of accounts in the process.
The activity, per Huntress , originates from an IPv6 address range ( 2a0a:d683::/32 ) controlled by internet infrastructure provider LSHIY LLC (AS32167…
