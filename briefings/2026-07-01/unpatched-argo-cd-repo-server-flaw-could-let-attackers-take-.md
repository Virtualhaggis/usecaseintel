## Threat Profile

Unpatched Argo CD Repo-Server Flaw Could Let Attackers Take Over Kubernetes Clusters 
 Swati Khandelwal  Jul 01, 2026 Kubernetes / Server Security 
Argo CD , a widely used tool for deploying software to Kubernetes, has an unpatched flaw in its repo-server component that lets an unauthenticated attacker run code, provided they can reach the component's internal network port.
Synacktiv , which found the bug, says it can lead to a full cluster takeover. There is no fix and no CVE. The firm says i…
