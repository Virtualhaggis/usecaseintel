Enterprise Defenses Recovered at the Edge and Collapsed Inside 
 The Hacker News  Aug 12, 2026 Security Validation / Attack Simulation 
Enterprise defenses are tuned to catch the attacks that make noise. This year's data shows attackers winning by making none.
According to Picus Labs' new Blue Report 2026 , which measured more than 338 million real attack simulations across actual client production environments in the first half of 2026, defenses are having one of their strongest years yet. Av…
