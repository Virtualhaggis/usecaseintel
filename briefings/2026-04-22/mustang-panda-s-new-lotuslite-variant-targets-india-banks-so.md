## Threat Profile

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new variant of a known malware called LOTUSLITE that's distributed via a theme related to India's banking sector. "The backdoor communicates with a dynamic DNS-based command-and-control server over HTTPS and supports remote shell access, file operations, and session management, indicating a continued espionage-focused capability set rather than

### Beaconing — periodic outbound to small set of destinations

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl

    from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
    where All_Traffic.action="allowed" AND All_Traffic.dest_category!="internal"

| where count > 30 AND sd_delta < 5 AND avg_delta>=30 AND avg_delta<=600

| sort by DeviceName asc, RemoteIP asc, RemotePort asc, Timestamp asc
