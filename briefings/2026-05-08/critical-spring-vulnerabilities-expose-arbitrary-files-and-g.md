Critical Spring Vulnerabilities Expose Arbitrary Files and GCP Secrets 
By Abinaya 
May 8, 2026 
Spring Cloud Config provides crucial server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in distributed systems.
Recently, the Spring development team disclosed four security vulnerabilities impacting the Spring Cloud Config Server. 
These flaws range from medium to critical severity, exposing environments to unauthorized arbitrary file access, cloud secrets l…

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Asset exposure — vulnerability matches article CVE(s)** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#asset-exposure)) — phase: **recon**, confidence: **High**
  - CVE(s): `CVE-2026-40982`, `CVE-2026-40981`, `CVE-2026-41002`, `CVE-2026-41004`


## Why this matters

Severity classified as **HIGH** based on: CVE present, 9 use case(s) fired, 13 technique(s) inferred. Read the full article for actor attribution, tooling details, and any defanged IOCs in the body that aren't visible in the RSS summary.
