Executive Summary 
Assessing AI security risks requires understanding how prompts are transformed inside the model and how these transformations create security gaps.
This post focuses on the initial stages of the LLM pipeline, including tokenization, embedding, and attention, to clarify how the model interprets input and where vulnerabilities arise.
We show how prompts can bypass t…

## Recommended hunts

### Asset exposure — vulnerability matches article CVE(s)

`_uc` · phase: **recon** · confidence: **High**

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
    from datamodel=Vulnerabilities
    where Vulnerabilities.signature IN ("-")
    by Vulnerabilities.dest, Vulnerabilities.signature, Vulnerabilities.severity, Vulnerabilities.cve
| `drop_dm_object_name(Vulnerabilities)`
| sort - severity
```

**Defender KQL:**
```kql
