Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. 
Metaphor is a powerful tool for understanding emerging issues in cybersecurity. Framing the unfamiliar in terms of the well understood helps us remove the burden of extraneous detail to draw focus to the real issues.

### Phishing-link click correlated to endpoint execution

`UC_PHISH_LINK` · phase: **delivery** · confidence: **High**

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Network connections to article IPs / domains** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#network-ioc)) — phase: **c2**, confidence: **High**
  - IP / domain IOC(s): `npm-cache.com`, `pypi-get.com`, `js-mirror.com`

- **File hash IOCs — endpoint file/process match** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#hash-ioc)) — phase: **install**, confidence: **High**
  - file hash IOC(s): `9f1f11a708d393e0a4109ae189bc64f1f3e312653dcf317a2bd406f18ffcc507`, `a31f222fc283227f5e7988d1ad9c0aecd66d58bb7b4d8518ae23e110308dbf91`, `9896a6fcb9bb5ac1ec5297b4a65be3f647589adf7c37b45f3f7466decd6a4a7f`, `90b1456cdbe6bc2779ea0b4736ed9a998a71ae37390331b6ba87e389a49d3d59`, `9fc2570b7cef51c1b8df116d144d11ff4096357be7d2c4c6367cfc2509cf1bcc`, `fd3ca4007b225fdf8de7af4345a19179d5efa8c4bb9205f88cda806e5684b1eb`, `54dc7ea54a1317cca0e890a2770630cf7fa6c97813e0cb9d2caa93012b350668`, `2915b3f8b703eb744fc54c81f4a9c67f` _(+3 more)_


## Why this matters

Severity classified as **HIGH** based on: IOCs present, 7 use case(s) fired, 10 technique(s) inferred. Read the full article for actor attribution, tooling details, and any defanged IOCs in the body that aren't visible in the RSS summary.
