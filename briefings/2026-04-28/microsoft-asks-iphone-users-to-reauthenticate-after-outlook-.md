**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
    from datamodel=Vulnerabilities
    where Vulnerabilities.signature IN ("-")
    by Vulnerabilities.dest, Vulnerabilities.signature, Vulnerabilities.severity, Vulnerabilities.cve
| `drop_dm_object_name(Vulnerabilities)`
| sort - severity
```

**Defender KQL:**
```kql

| where CveId in~ ("-")
| join kind=inner DeviceInfo on DeviceId
| project DeviceName, OSPlatform, CveId, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel, RecommendedSecurityUpdate
```

### Microsoft Teams external-tenant chat from unverified IT-helpdesk impersonator
