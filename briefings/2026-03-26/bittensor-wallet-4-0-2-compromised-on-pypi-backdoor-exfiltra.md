## Threat Profile

Back to Blog Threat Intel bittensor-wallet 4.0.2 Compromised on PyPI - Backdoor Exfiltrates Private Keys On March 17, 2026, bittensor-wallet 4.0.2 was identified as a compromised PyPI package. The malicious release had been live on PyPI for approximately 48 hours before being yanked. This post is a ground-up technical breakdown based on a direct diff of the source tarballs for versions 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 — covering exactly what changed, how the backdoor works, and what defenders should do. We also …

## Recommended hunts

### Beaconing — periodic outbound to small set of destinations

`UC_BEACONING` · phase: **c2** · confidence: **Medium**

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count, values(All_Traffic.dest_port) AS ports
    from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
    where All_Traffic.action="allowed" AND All_Traffic.dest_category!="internal"
    by _time span=10s, All_Traffic.src, All_Traffic.dest
| `drop_dm_object_name(All_Traffic)`
| streamstats current=f last(_time) AS prev_time by src, dest
| eval delta = _time - prev_time
| stats avg(delta) AS avg_delta stdev(delta) AS sd_delta count by src, dest
| where count > 30 AND sd_delta < 5 AND avg_delta>=30 AND avg_delta<=600
| sort - count
```

**Defender KQL:**
```kql

### DNS tunneling / TXT-heavy domain queries

`UC_DNS_TUNNEL` · phase: **c2** · confidence: **Medium**

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **File hash IOCs — endpoint file/process match** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#hash-ioc)) — phase: **install**, confidence: **High**
  - file hash IOC(s): `6a416b72ff24804abc12484a3b41413a8580acedd8a5f8c84224fcf0732c2f8e`, `edc2588d5e272835285e4171dd3daf862149f617015bf52e43d433d8e5c297c5`


## Why this matters

Severity classified as **CRIT** based on: IOCs present, 6 use case(s) fired, 7 technique(s) inferred. Read the full article for actor attribution, tooling details, and any defanged IOCs in the body that aren't visible in the RSS summary.
