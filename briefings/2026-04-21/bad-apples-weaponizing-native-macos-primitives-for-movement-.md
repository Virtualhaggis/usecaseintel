Threat Spotlight
As macOS adoption grows among developers and DevOps, it has become a high value target; however, native "living-off-the-land" (LOTL) techniques for the platform remain significantly under-documented compared to Windows. 
Adversaries can bypass security controls by repurposing native features like Remote Application Scripting (RAS) fo…

## Indicators of Compromise (high-fidelity only)

- **IPv4 (defanged):** `1.3.6.1`

## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

- **T1190** — Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **T1021.002** — SMB/Windows Admin Shares
- **T1569.002** — Service Execution
- **T1219** — Remote Access Software
- **T1071** — Application Layer Protocol

## Recommended hunts

### Asset exposure — vulnerability matches article CVE(s)

`_uc` · phase: **recon** · confidence: **High**

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
    from datamodel=Vulnerabilities
    where Vulnerabilities.signature IN ("-")
    by Vulnerabilities.dest, Vulnerabilities.signature, Vulnerabilities.severity, Vulnerabilities.cve
| `drop_dm_object_name(Vulnerabilities)`
| sort - severity
```

**Defender KQL:**
```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where CveId in~ ("-")
| join kind=inner DeviceInfo on DeviceId
| project DeviceName, OSPlatform, CveId, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel, RecommendedSecurityUpdate
```

### Remote service execution — PsExec / SMB lateral movement

`UC_LATERAL_PSEXEC` · phase: **actions** · confidence: **High**

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
    from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
    where Processes.process_name IN ("psexec.exe","psexesvc.exe","paexec.exe","smbexec.py")
       OR (Processes.process_name="wmic.exe" AND Processes.process="*/node:*")
    by Processes.dest, Processes.user, Processes.process_name, Processes.process, Processes.parent_process_name
| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
```

**Defender KQL:**
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName in~ ("psexec.exe","psexesvc.exe","paexec.exe","smbexec.py")
   or (FileName =~ "wmic.exe" and ProcessCommandLine has "/node:")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

### RMM tool installed by non-IT user — remote-access utility for hands-on-keyboard

`UC_RMM_TOOLS` · phase: **install** · confidence: **High**

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
    from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
    where Processes.process_name IN ("AnyDesk.exe","TeamViewer.exe","TeamViewer_Service.exe",
        "ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe","ConnectWiseControl.ClientService.exe",
        "atera_agent.exe","SplashtopStreamer.exe","RustDesk.exe","NinjaOne.exe","kaseya*.exe")
    by Processes.dest, Processes.user, Processes.process_name, Processes.process, Processes.parent_process_name
| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
```

**Defender KQL:**
```kql

        "ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe","ConnectWiseControl.ClientService.exe",
        "atera_agent.exe","SplashtopStreamer.exe","RustDesk.exe","NinjaOne.exe")
   or FileName matches regex @"(?i)kaseya.*\.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

### Network connections to article IPs / domains

`UC_NETWORK_IOC` · phase: **c2** · confidence: **High**

**Splunk SPL (CIM):**
```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
    from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
    where All_Traffic.dest IN ("1.3.6.1")
    by All_Traffic.src, All_Traffic.dest, All_Traffic.dest_port
| `drop_dm_object_name(All_Traffic)`

        where DNS.query IN ("example.invalid")
        by DNS.src, DNS.query, DNS.answer

**Defender KQL:**
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where RemoteIP in ("1.3.6.1") or RemoteUrl has_any ("example.invalid")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl,
