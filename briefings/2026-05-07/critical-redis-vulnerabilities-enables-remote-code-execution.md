Critical Redis Vulnerabilities Enables Remote Code Execution Attacks 
By Abinaya 
May 7, 2026 
Five dangerous vulnerabilities in Redis expose Redis Cloud, Redis Software, and all open-source community editions to potential remote code execution, giving authenticated attackers a direct path to compromise affected systems.
All require authenticated access to exploit, but successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution , full system compromise, data exfiltrati…
