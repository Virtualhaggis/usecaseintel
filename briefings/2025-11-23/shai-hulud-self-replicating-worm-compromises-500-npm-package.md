## Threat Profile

Back to Blog Threat Intel Shai-Hulud: Self-Replicating Worm Compromises 500+ NPM Packages The Shai-Hulud worm has infected over 500 NPM packages including @ctrl/tinycolor in an unprecedented self-propagating supply chain attack. The malware harvests AWS/GCP/Azure credentials using TruffleHog, establishes persistence through GitHub Actions backdoors, and automatically spreads to other maintainer packages - marking the first successful worm attack in the NPM ecosystem.

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **File hash IOCs — endpoint file/process match** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#hash-ioc)) — phase: **install**, confidence: **High**
  - file hash IOC(s): `46faab8ab153fae6e80e7cca38eab363075bb524edd79e42269217a083628f09`
