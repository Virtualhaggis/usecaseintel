GuardFall Exposes Open-Source AI Coding Agents to Decades-Old Shell Injection Risks 
 Swati Khandelwal  Jun 30, 2026 AI Security / Software Supply Chain 
The safety check that is supposed to stop an AI coding agent from running a dangerous command can be walked straight past using a shell trick that has been public for decades.
New research from  Adversa AI , which is named the bypass GuardFall , found it works against ten of the eleven popular open-source coding and computer-use agents the fi…
