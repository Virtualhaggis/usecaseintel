Dysphoria IoT Botnet Adds Blockchain C2 and Victim Relays After JackSkid Disruption 
 Swati Khandelwal  Jul 27, 2026 Botnet / IoT Security 
Dysphoria , an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet line tracked by CNCERT and XLab, has adopted blockchain-based name services and infected-device relays after a March law-enforcement operation against JackSkid infrastructure. The researchers say the design makes the botnet harder to disrupt.
CNCERT, China's national computer emergency response team, and XLab,…

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Network connections to article IPs / domains** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#network-ioc)) — phase: **c2**, confidence: **High**
  - IP / domain IOC(s): `194.87.198.208`, `194.87.198.104`, `194.58.38.79`, `194.58.38.49`, `194.58.38.96`, `m3rnbvs5d.eth`, `burrberry.eth`, `24carnforth2merseyside.sol`

- **Asset exposure — vulnerability matches article CVE(s)** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#asset-exposure)) — phase: **recon**, confidence: **High**
  - CVE(s): `CVE-2025-9528`
