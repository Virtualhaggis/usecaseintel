### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Asset exposure — vulnerability matches article CVE(s)** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#asset-exposure)) — phase: **recon**, confidence: **High**
  - CVE(s): `CVE-2025-20333`, `CVE-2025-20362`, `CVE-2024-42009`, `CVE-2024-37383`, `CVE-2025-49113`, `CVE-2025-48700`, `CVE-2024-55591`, `CVE-2024-21762` _(+11 more)_


## Why this matters

Severity classified as **CRIT** based on: CVE present, 20 use case(s) fired, 35 technique(s) inferred. Read the full article for actor attribution, tooling details, and any defanged IOCs in the body that aren't visible in the RSS summary.
