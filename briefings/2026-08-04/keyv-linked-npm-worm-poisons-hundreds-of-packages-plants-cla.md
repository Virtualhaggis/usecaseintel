Keyv-Linked npm Worm Poisons Hundreds of Packages, Plants Claude Code and VS Code Hooks 
 Swati Khandelwal  Aug 04, 2026 Supply Chain Attack / Malware 
A credential-stealing npm worm that first appeared in keyv@6.0.0 spread beyond the Keyv and Cacheable namespaces into hundreds of packages across multiple organizations on August 4, 2026.
SafeDep verified 353 poisoned versions across 79 package names in the npm registry. Its monitoring put the wider footprint at 442 versions across 353 names, w…

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Network connections to article IPs / domains** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#network-ioc)) — phase: **c2**, confidence: **High**
  - IP / domain IOC(s): `npm-cache.com`

- **File hash IOCs — endpoint file/process match** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#hash-ioc)) — phase: **install**, confidence: **High**
  - file hash IOC(s): `54dc7ea54a1317cca0e890a2770630cf7fa6c97813e0cb9d2caa93012b350668`, `fd3ca4007b225fdf8de7af4345a19179d5efa8c4bb9205f88cda806e5684b1eb`, `9fc2570b7cef51c1b8df116d144d11ff4096357be7d2c4c6367cfc2509cf1bcc`
