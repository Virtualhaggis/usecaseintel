Top AI Agents Built to Catch Malicious Code Can Be Tricked Into Running It 
 Swati Khandelwal  Jul 09, 2026 AI Security / Vulnerability 
Ask an AI coding agent to scan open-source code for security holes, and it might run the attacker's code on your own machine instead.
That is the finding in a  proof-of-concept published Wednesday by the AI Now Institute, an attack it calls " Friendly Fire. " It works against Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex when either is running in an autonomous m…
