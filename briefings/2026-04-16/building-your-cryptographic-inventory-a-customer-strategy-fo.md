Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is coming—and for most organizations, the hardest part won’t be choosing new algorithms. It will be finding where cryptography is used today across applications, infrastructure, devices, and services so teams can plan, prioritize, and modernize with confidence. At Microsoft, we view this as the practical foundation of quantum readiness: you can’t protect or migrate what you…
