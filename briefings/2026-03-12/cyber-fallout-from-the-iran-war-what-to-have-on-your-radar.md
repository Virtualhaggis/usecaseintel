## Threat Profile

The war in Iran was less than 24 hours old when it produced a historic first: the deliberate targeting of commercial data centers. On March 1 st , Iranian drones hit three Amazon Web Services (AWS) facilities in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, disrupting core cloud infrastructure and knocking out finance apps and enterprise tools not only across the Gulf, but also far away from the region . The attacks showed that physical distance from a conflict zone is no guarantee of insulation from th…
