### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Network connections to article IPs / domains** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#network-ioc)) — phase: **c2**, confidence: **High**
  - IP / domain IOC(s): `212.127.73.235`, `167.86.100.68`, `185.220.101.16`, `185.220.101.15`, `agrocenter-eurohem.ru`, `ruspromexport-group.ru`, `www.ruspromexport-group.ru`, `mail.ruspromexport-group.ru` _(+1 more)_


## Why this matters

Severity classified as **HIGH** based on: IOCs present, 8 use case(s) fired, 14 technique(s) inferred. Read the full article for actor attribution, tooling details, and any defanged IOCs in the body that aren't visible in the RSS summary.
