Ongoing research into AI agent framework security identified an exploit chain in AutoGen Studio (AutoGen’s open-source prototyping user interface) that allows untrusted web content rendered by a browsing agent to reach a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) WebSocket and spawn arbitrary processes on the host. The technique, which we call AutoJack, jacks the agent into becoming the at…
