Hackers Use Microsoft Teams to Steal Credentials and Manipulate MFA 
By Guru Baran 
May 6, 2026 
Iranian APT group MuddyWater deployed Chaos ransomware as a “false flag” in a sophisticated hybrid espionage campaign targeting Western organizations, bypassing encryption in favor of data theft and long-term persistence.
In early 2026, Rapid7 incident responders were called into what initially appeared to be a routine Chaos ransomware intrusion, but forensic analysis quickly …

### IOC-driven hunts (use shared templates)

These are standard IOC-substitution hunts — the canonical SPL and KQL live once in [`_TEMPLATES.md`](../_TEMPLATES.md), so we don't repeat the same boilerplate on every CVE / hash / network-IOC briefing.

- **Network connections to article IPs / domains** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#network-ioc)) — phase: **c2**, confidence: **High**
  - IP / domain IOC(s): `172.86.126.208`, `moonzonet.com`, `uploadfiler.com`, `adm-pulse.com`

- **File hash IOCs — endpoint file/process match** ([template](../_TEMPLATES.md#hash-ioc)) — phase: **install**, confidence: **High**
  - file hash IOC(s): `B674578D4BDB24CD58BF2DC884EAA658B7AA250C`


## Why this matters

Severity classified as **CRIT** based on: IOCs present, 18 use case(s) fired, 29 technique(s) inferred. Read the full article for actor attribution, tooling details, and any defanged IOCs in the body that aren't visible in the RSS summary.
